Many properties of the natural numbers can be derived from
the five Peano axioms:

* 0 is a natural number.
* Every natural number has a successor.
* 0 is not the successor of any natural number.
* If the successor of x equals the successor of y,
  then x equals y.
* The axiom of induction: 
  If a statement is true of 0, and if the truth of that 
  statement for a number implies its truth for the 
  successor of that number, then the statement is true
  for every natural number.

Some forms of the Peano axioms have 1 in place of 0. In 
ordinary arithmetic, the successor of x is x+1.
